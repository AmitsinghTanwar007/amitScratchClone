1) Hero feature-
Two animated objects move around in the preview area. When they collide, they instantly swap their animations. After the swap, they separate and are repositioned randomly within the preview area, setting up for another potential interaction.
(if this feature is not working then please reload 2 to 3 times so you will get the updated website because i was facing the same problem but resolved by this method).
