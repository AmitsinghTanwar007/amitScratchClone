About the Scratch clone
features
1) Hero feature-
Two animated objects move around in the preview area. When they collide, they instantly swap their animations. After the swap, they separate and are repositioned randomly within the preview area, setting up for another potential interaction.
(if this feature is not working then wait for 1 to 2 minutes then it will be working).
